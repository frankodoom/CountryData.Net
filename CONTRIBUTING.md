### How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to CountryData.Net:

#### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue on GitHub. Make sure to describe the problem in detail, including steps to reproduce the issue, what you expect to happen, and what actually happens.

#### Suggesting Enhancements

For feature requests and enhancements, open an issue first to discuss the change you wish to make. This allows us to better coordinate efforts, prevent duplicate work, and help define the scope of the proposal.

#### Creating Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the project. They allow us to review your modifications before merging them into the main branch. Please follow these steps to create a pull request:

1. Fork the Project Repository, *Note* Fork from `development` branch.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Commit your changes to the new branch.
4. Push your branch to GitHub.
5. Open a Pull Request against the original repository.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following rules:

- Each pull request should implement one feature or fix a bug.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface.
- Increase coverage by writing unit tests.
- Check existing open issues/pull requests first to avoid duplicating effort.

### Style Guide

- Follow the existing style guide. Consistency is key!
- Keep commits small and focused. Large commits are hard to review and often lead to merge conflicts.
- Write meaningful commit messages. Good practice is to write clear, concise messages that explain what was changed and why.


Remember, every contribution counts, no matter how big or small. Thank you for taking the time to improve CountryData.Net!
